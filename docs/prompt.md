Analyze documentation files (README.md and under docs/).
Observations: Documentation is outdated. Some documented features are not yet fully implemented, project is under development.
Split documentation into logical modules: README, Functional Specification, Technical Specification and module-level specifications.
DRY.
Keep changes to existing text minimal and necessary.
Reduce Markdown highlighting (bold) to minimum.
Use Unicode symbols to mark status:
  - ‚úîÔ∏è: Completed
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è: Partially completed or misaligned
  - ‚ùå: Not implemented or missing
  - üîß: In progress or needs refinement
Add to README how to run app with docker.
Add to README how to integrate with existing apache reverse proxy serving netbox site.

When I would ask you to provide updated version of document, format is with standard markdown and output as code block.
