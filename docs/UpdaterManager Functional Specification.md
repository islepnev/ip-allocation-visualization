# UpdaterManager Functional Specification

- **Execute Updater Function:**
  - Trigger immediately upon receiving a webhook if no updater is currently running.
  - Schedule subsequent runs during webhook bursts with a minimum interval of one minute between executions.
  - Ensure the latest webhook data is processed without missing updates.

- **Concurrency Control:**
  - Prevent multiple instances of the updater from running simultaneously.
  - Utilize thread-safe mechanisms to manage updater state and execution.

- **Asynchronous Operation:**
  - Run the updater in a separate thread to maintain web application responsiveness.
  - Ensure that the main application thread is not blocked during updater execution.

- **Initialization Behavior:**
  - Automatically trigger an initial updater run shortly after application startup (e.g., after a 1-second delay).

- **Debounce Logic:**
  - Implement a debounce mechanism to handle rapid, consecutive webhook events efficiently.
  - Reset debounce timers appropriately to prevent unnecessary updater runs.

- **Thread Safety:**
  - Use locks or other synchronization primitives to manage shared state safely.
  - Avoid race conditions and deadlocks through careful lock management and minimal locking scopes.

- **Compatibility with WSGI Servers:**
  - Design the UpdaterManager to operate correctly in environments with multiple worker processes (e.g., Gunicorn).
  - Ensure that only one updater instance runs across all worker processes, possibly by externalizing the updater process.

- **Graceful Shutdown:**
  - Allow the UpdaterManager to terminate cleanly when the application shuts down.
  - Ensure that ongoing updater processes are completed or safely terminated during shutdown.

- **Configuration:**
  - Allow debounce intervals and other relevant settings to be configurable via environment variables or configuration files.
  - Enable easy adjustments to updater behavior without modifying the core codebase.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Capture and log exceptions occurring during updater execution.
  - Prevent unhandled exceptions in the updater from crashing the application.

- **Extensibility:**
  - Design the UpdaterManager to support future enhancements, such as distributed updates or integration with external task queues.
